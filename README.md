With COVID-19 in everyone's mind, which has spread globally causing over 13.4 million cases and 579, 500 deaths, we developed a Machine Learning Model to accurately and consistently predict people's choices around vaccination using historical National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey
data.
Humans are not perfect and neither are machines. Machines can process more information and make consistent decisions. Humans can navigate gray areas and think strategically . So how can Humans and Machines compliment each other?????
We designed an user interface to pit Human against Machine to highlight the relative strength and contributions of each.
